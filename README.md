# Simple-ClassLoader

A super simple classloader made in java, this uses a pastebin url to read a dowload link and injects the classess into the classpath and then run a method from said classess


## Setup
Make a pastebin and have the dowload to your jar as the content like this: https://pastebin.com/raw/DvUc3HXa

change the url in the Loader.java to your raw pastebin url and change the class and method you want to launch
